					<!--<img src="download(3).png" align="left">-->
					</div>
					<br/><ul>
					<li>	<div id="d1" style="cursor:pointer;" >What should I do after donating blood?
							<div id="panel1">
					<ul>
					<li>Take the following precautions:
					<ol>
					<li> Drink an extra four glasses (eight ounces each) of non-alcoholic liquids.</li>
					<li> Keep your bandage on and dry for the next five hours, and do not do heavy exercising or lifting.</li>
					<li>Because you could experience dizziness or loss of strength, use caution if you plan to do anything that could put you or others at risk of harm. For any hazardous occupation or hobby, follow applicable safety recommendations regarding your return to these activities following a blood donation.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>f you get dizzy or lightheaded:  Stop what you are doing, lie down, and raise your feet until the feeling passes and you feel well enough to safely resume activities</li>
					<li><strong>And remember to enjoy the feeling of knowing you have helped save lives!</strong></li>
					
					</ul>
							</div>
						</div></li>
						<li><div id="d2" style="cursor:pointer;">Will it hurt when you insert the needle?
			
							<div id="panel2"><p>Only for a moment. Pinch the fleshy, soft underside of your arm. That pinch is similar to what you will feel when the needle is inserted.</p>
							</div>
			
			
						</div></li>
						<li><div id="d3" style="cursor:pointer;">How long does a blood donation take?
							<div id="panel3"><p>The entire process takes about one hour and 15 minutes; the actual donation of a pint of whole blood unit takes eight to 10 minutes. However, the time varies slightly with each person depending on several factors including the donor’s health history and attendance at the blood drive.</p>
							</div>
						</div></li>
						<li><div id="d4" style="cursor:pointer;">How long will I take to replenish the pint of blood that I donate?
									<div id="panel4"><p>The plasma from your donation is replaced within about 24 hours. Red cells need about four to six weeks for complete replacement. That’s why at least eight weeks are required between whole blood donations.
									</div>
							</div></li>
						</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="eligibility">
					<div id="elih" style="text-align:center;font-size:30px;">Eligibility</div>
						<ul>
						<li><div id="e1" style="cursor:pointer;">How often can I donate blood?
								<div id="panel5"><p>You must wait at least eight weeks (56 days) between donations of whole blood and 16 weeks (112 days) between double red cell donations. Platelet apheresis donors may give every 7 days up to 24 times per year. Regulations are different for those giving blood for themselves (autologous donors).</p>
								</div>
								</div></li>
						<li><div id="e2" style="cursor:pointer;">Who can donate blood?
								<div id="panel6"><p>In most states, donors must be age 17 or older. Some states allow donation by 16-year-olds with a signed parental consent form. Donors must weigh at least 110 pounds and be in good health. Additional eligibility criteria apply.
								</div>
							</div></li>
							</ul>
					</div>
				<div id="platelets">
					<div id="plateh" style="text-align:center;font-size:30px;"><b>Platelet Donation</b></div>
						<ul>
							<li><div id="p1" style="cursor:pointer;">What are platelets and how are they used?
							<div id="panel7"><p>Apheresis is the process by which platelets and other specific blood components (red cells or plasma) are collected from a donor. The word “apheresis” is derived from the Greek word aphaeresis meaning “to take away.” This process is accomplished by using a machine called a cell separator. Blood is drawn from the donor and the platelets, or another blood component, are collected by the cell separator and the remaining components of the blood are returned to the donor during the donation. Each apheresis donation procedure takes about one-and-one-half to two hours. Donors can watch movies or relax during the donation.</p>
							</div>
							</div></li>
							<li><div id="p2" style="cursor:pointer;">How often can I give platelets?
								<div id="panel8"><p>Every 7 days up to 24 apheresis donations can be made in a year. Some apheresis donations can generate two or three adult-sized platelet transfusion doses from one donation!</p>
								</div>
								</div></li>
						</ul>
						</div>
					<div id="safety">
						<div id="safeh" style="text-align:center;font-size:30px;"><b>Blood Safety</b></div>
						<ul>
						<li><div id="s1" style="cursor:pointer;">Is it safe to give blood?
								<div id="panel9"><p>Donating blood is a safe process. Each donor’s blood is collected through a new, sterile needle that is used once and then discarded. Although most people feel fine after donating blood, a small number of people may feel lightheaded or dizzy, have an upset stomach or experience a bruise or pain where the needle was inserted. Extremely rarely, loss of consciousness, nerve damage or artery damage occur.</p>
								</div>
							</div></li>
						<li><div id="s2" style="cursor:pointer;">Can I get HIV from donating blood?
							<div id="panel10"><p>No. Sterile procedures and disposable equipment are used in all Red Cross donor centers. We use a needle only once and then dispose of it. You cannot contract HIV or other viral disease by donating blood.</p>
							</div>
							</div></li>
						<li><div id="s3" style="cursor:pointer;">What tests are administered to ensure that my blood is safe to donate to the patients?
							<div id="panel11">
								<ul>BLOOD DONATIONS ARE TESTED FOR THE FOLLOWING
								<li>ABO and Rh blood types.</li>
								<li>Unexpected red blood cell antibodies that are a result of prior transfusion, pregnancy, or other factors.</li>
								<li>Hepatitis B surface antigen, indicating a current infection (hepatitis) or carrier state for hepatitis B virus.</li>
								<li>Antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, indicator of a present or past infection with the hepatitis B virus.<li>
								<li>Antibody to hepatitis C virus, indicating a current or past infection with hepatitis C virus (most common cause of non-A/non-B hepatitis).</li>
								<li>Antibody to HTLV-I/II, indicator of infection with a virus that may cause adult T-cell leukemia or neurological disease.</li>
								<li>Antibody to HIV-1/2, indicator of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)<li>
								<li>Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) for hepatitis C (HCV), hepatitis B (HBV) and HIV.</li>
								<li>Screening test for antibodies to syphilis.</li>
								<li>NAT for West Nile Virus (WNV).</li>
								<li>Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) test for Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas Disease).</li>
								in addition to these all platelet apheresis donations are tested.
								</ul>
							</div>	
					
					
					</div>
					<li><div id="s4" style="cursor:pointer;">Is it true that I can get a free AIDs test when I donate blood?
					<div id="panel12"><p>You should not give blood to get tested for AIDS. Using blood donation as a way to get tested could put the blood supply at risk and endanger patients. HIV antibodies may take a few weeks to develop after infection with the virus. If you were recently infected, you might have a negative test result, yet be able to infect the recipient of your donation. That is why you must not give blood if you are at risk of getting AIDS or other infectious diseases. Individuals at risk for contracting HIV should contact their local health department for AIDS testing.</p>
